## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?


During this project, I deepened my grasp of HTML tags and properties, which boosted my confidence. Despite initial nerves, I smoothly applied various CSS properties like flex-box, handling multiple images using overflow, and more. Implementing animations was another significant learning curve during this process. The challenge arose as the project was initially built entirely with JavaScript, making HTML and CSS implementation tricky. Turning to Google, I discovered useful CSS properties like overflow, webkit scrollbar, input:focus, and honed my understanding of implementing animations effectively. This experience highlighted CSS's efficiency in enhancing the user's visual experience.
